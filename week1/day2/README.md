# Week 1 - Day 2
## Functions

Try to write the tests for each exercise, then solve the problem. If your solutions are correct, your tests will pass. 

### 1. `max`

Write a function called `max` that returns the larger of two numbers passed as arguments.

### 2. Prime number checker

Write a function called `is` using a loop that returns `true` or `false` based on if the number passed in is prime.

- Negative numbers are not prime
- Zero is not prime
- One is not prime

### 3. Prime number checker 2.0

Write a function called `is` using _recursion_ that returns `true` or `false` based on if the number passed in is prime.

### 4. Array to Array of strings

Write a function called `toStringArray` that takes an array of any types, casts each element to a string, and returns an array of the results using `map`.

### 5. Array flattening

Use the `reduce` method to flatten array of arrays into a single array.

Example input:

```javascript
var arrays = [[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6]];
```

Example output:

```javascript
var output = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
